Project: ShapeDrawn
Author: Jie Chen
Date: Oct 27th, 2014

Description: ShapeDrawn is an iPhone app that allows its users to  draw shapes
(lines, rectangles and ovals) on its canvas. Just remeber to set the properties
of the shapes before it is to be drawn.

1. Runing environment
-The app is targeted for iPhone Retina 4-inches only and its orientation is forced to be portrait.
-The app was developed using XCode 5.1.1 purely with Objective-C.
-Check it out with Xcode 5.1.1 and iPhone 4-inches simulator.
(Xcode 6.1 is not stable enough for me to upgrade)

2. Features to be added
-Allowing users to pick a color to draw shapes
-Adding coordinate system grid on the canvas
-Enabling zoom in and out of the shapes
